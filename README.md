- Hi, Iâ€™m A Valor
- Iâ€™m interested in all things tech but i dont know all thing techðŸ˜‰. I also like marketing, especially digital marketing.
  Iâ€™m currently learning Cyber Security Science at the Nigerian University of Technology and Management.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that i can learn from (except the occult) even if outside the ground of Cyber Security.
- You can reach me by commenting on my repository work, and my various(not really various) updates regarding anything.
- I am also looking for potential internship programmes and opportunities so if you or your company has a proposition for me I'll be willing to hear it.
