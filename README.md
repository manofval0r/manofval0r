- Hi, I’m Valor
- I’m interested in all things tech but i dont know all things tech.
  I’m currently learning Cyber Security Science.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can learn from (except the occult) even if outside the ground of Cyber Security.
- You can reach me by commenting on my repository work, and my various(not really various) updates regarding anything.
- I am also looking for potential internship programmes and opportunities so if you or your company has a proposition for me I'll be willing to hear it.
